            <h2>Every idea <img id="idea" src="assets/img/idea.png" alt=""> <br> starts with a need</h2>
            <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and
                attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper
                and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with
                what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really
                liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any
                problem.</p>

                    It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected you, like finding your keys, calling
                    a taxi or even remembering something. Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay close
                    attention to your surroundings.
